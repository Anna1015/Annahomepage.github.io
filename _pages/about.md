Hi there, my name is Anna. I am a PhD student at the [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/). My primary research interests are in machine learning and optimization. My long-term research goal is to ..... Topics that I focus on include:
  - **Active learning** : Active learning is a type of machine learning where the model actively chooses which data it wants to learn from, rather than being passively fed all the available data. The goal of active learning is to improve the efficiency of the learning process and to reduce the amount of labeled data that is needed to train a model. In active learning, the model selects a small subset of the data to label and learn from, while the rest of the data remains unlabeled. The model can then use this labeled data to make predictions about the unlabeled data, which can be used to improve its accuracy. Active learning can be particularly useful in situations where it is expensive or time-consuming to label large amounts of data, or when there is a shortage of labeled data.
  - **Active feature acquisition** :Active feature acquisition is a type of active learning that specifically focuses on selecting which features (i.e., input variables or characteristics) the model should learn from, rather than selecting individual data points. The goal of active feature acquisition is to improve the efficiency of the learning process by identifying the most useful or predictive features for a particular task. In active feature acquisition, the model selects a small subset of the available features to learn from, and uses this subset to make predictions about the target variable. The model can then use the performance of these predictions to determine which features are most useful and should be included in the model. Active feature acquisition can be particularly useful in situations where there are a large number of features available and it is not clear which features will be most useful for a particular task.
  - **Meta learning** :Meta learning is a type of machine learning where the goal is to learn how to learn. More specifically, meta learning involves training a model to learn a new task quickly by using knowledge gained from previous tasks. In meta learning, the model is presented with a sequence of tasks and must learn to adapt to each task as efficiently as possible, using the knowledge it has gained from the previous tasks. The hope is that this will enable the model to learn new tasks more quickly and effectively than if it had to learn each task from scratch.

We propose Contrastive Goal Grouping (COGOAL), a self-supervised goal embedding algorithm for learning a well-structured latent goal space to simplify goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Compared to conventional reconstruction-based methods such as variational autoencoder, our approach can benefit from previously learnt goals and achieve better generalizability.
